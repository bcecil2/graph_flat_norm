Done:

1. The boundary points in the voronoi calculation seem to be causing our issues, both related to disks disappearing at the correct lambda
and numerical "glitches" causing random chunks to be taken out
2. What happens is that the boundary points aren't getting the same area as interior points on the regular grid,
the algorithm seems very sensitive to this, and while adding padding to the boundary box fixes it if we add 
precisely the right amount, even trying to infer what this padding should be from the points (0.02 vs 0.2016...) is enough to
cause numerical errors and mess up lambda/disk disappearance, if we keep using vornoi we probably need to fix this
and figure out what to do for the irregular case which seems intractable
3. right now we propose that we don't use the voronoi because it fixes the regular grid, should find a test
for irregular grid and compare error with and without voronoi
4. made tests for disappearing disks with lambda, seems more exact with voronoi + padding
5. tested irregular grid with regular circle and see how lambda is affected, results in numerical_experiments folder
6. make test_rectangle in test_flat_norm, it cuts off edges as expected with voronoi
7. corrected voronoi padding calculation to be based on only 4 nearest neighbors

Todo:
could revive image code and try it on images, do it on the star

come up with an irregular grid test to compare voronoi with and without
idea for checking voronoi vs not voronoi: increase lambda until you get the original set back, then back off lambda a little
and measure error
