Done:

1. can't really rewrite preflow push in numba because it requires a bunch of heuristics unless we want to comitt
to a big project
2. test reduced angles in test_sys_reducer
3. reducer is correct, maybe investigate order of things once they have weights?
4. tested weight system for equality with paper, one value off in 4th decimal place (rounding error?)
5. tested weight system for equality and size (if still broken test more thoroughly)
6. added compile_graph function to graph_solver, sums weights across same edges and returns weighted edge list

Todo:

docstrings for weight system
docstrings for graph solver

order test for weight system
order test for graph solver (compile graph)
