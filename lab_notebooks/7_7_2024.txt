Done:

1. Finished tests for kdtree
2. Wrote docstrings for kdtree
3. In the future, in any file, the function called by flat_norm will have a docstring, helper functions will have
short descriptors of what they do (see kdtree.py for example)
4. Made test_voronoi with tests for uniform and nonuniform grids, checking average values
5. write docstrings for voronoi.py
6. wrote tests for regular and irregular grouping of vectors, fixed major bug that was grouping things under multiple
representatives

Todo:
test reduced angles in test_sys_reducer

write own graph and preflow push in numba?
